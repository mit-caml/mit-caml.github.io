Protein structure-based homology detection has been revolutionized by deep learning methods that can rapidly search massive databases. However, current structural
search tools often miss proteins related by topological rearrangements, particularly
circular permutation (CP), where proteins share identical global folds but differ
in the positioning of their termini. We introduce a circular permutation-invariant
graph neural network (CIRPIN) that addresses this limitation through a novel
data augmentation strategy using synthetic circular permutations (synCPs). We
demonstrate that CIRPIN learns representations of proteins that are invariant to
circular permutation, enabling it to identify similar proteins within the Structural
Classification of Proteins - extended (SCOPe) and AlphaFold Cluster Representatives (AFDB-ClustR) databases. Leveraging the speed of CIRPIN and the accuracy
of traditional structural alignment tools, we search these databases and uncover
thousands of novel protein pairs related by circular permutation. Notably, we
discover that PDZ domains exist naturally in four circularly permuted forms. These
results highlight CIRPIN as a powerful tool to investigate the emergence of circular
permutations in nature.

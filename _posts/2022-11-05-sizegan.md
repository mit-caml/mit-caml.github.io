Online clothing catalogs lack diversity in body shape
and garment size. Brands commonly display their garments
on models of one or two sizes, rarely including plus-size
models. To our knowledge, our paper presents the first
method for generating images of garments and models in
a new target size to tackle the size under-representation
problem. Our primary technical contribution is a conditional 
generative adversarial network that learns deformation fields 
at multiple resolutions to realistically change
the size of models and garments. Results from our two
user studies show SizeGAN outperforms alternative methods 
along three dimensions – realism, garment faithfulness,
and size – which are all important for real world use.

Given a pair of images—target person and garment on another person—we
automatically generate the target person in the given garment. Previous
methods mostly focused on texture transfer via paired data training, while
overlooking body shape deformations, skin color, and seamless blending of
garment with the person. This work focuses on those three components,
while also not requiring paired data training. We designed a pose conditioned
StyleGAN2 architecture with a clothing segmentation branch that is trained
on images of people wearing garments. Once trained, we propose a new
layered latent space interpolation method that allows us to preserve and
synthesize skin color and target body shape while transferring the garment
from a different person. We demonstrate results on high resolution 512×512
images, and extensively compare to state of the art in try-on on both latent
space generated and real images.
